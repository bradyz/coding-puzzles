0. SUMMARY:
This paper is addresses problems with the FT salient region dataset, compares
object segmentation and saliency algorithms, introduces their own dataset,
and proposes their own approach for salient object segmentation.

1. MAIN CONTRIBUTION:
The main ideas proposed in this paper is exposing the bias in benchmark datasets.
Another main contribution is relating fixation, saliency, and segmentation
all together, since the similarities and differences are subtle.

2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES:
Their proposed method for salient object detection is composed of two parts -
candidates, and a ranking functio based on fixation. This provides the main
strength that it is modular in design, allowing for flexibility between
segmentation algorithms, and fixation prediction algorithms used.
One of the weaknesses is probably the size of the PASCAL-S datset that was
constructed for this paper. The amount of pictures gathered was less than 1000,
and this is not substantial training data for certain learning methods.

3. INSPIRING TOPICS:
I thought it was interesting how the authors identified that there was a problem
with consistency in the previously used benchmarks and actually found a way to
quantify the inconsistencies.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
The paper provides a thorough analysis on seven of the current state of the art
saliency object segmentation algorithms and tests these on four popular benchmark
datasets. The metrics used are F-measures and AUC scores, which provide information
about the relationship between precision recall. Another metric used is s-AUC,
which normalizes the effect of center bias.

5. EXTENSIONS:
Some future extensions include providing fixation ground truth for other object
segmentation datasets, and finding other sources of bias. It is important to
minimize the amount of bias in these benchmarks, or at least find different
metrics as the object segmentation models will just learn the bias instead of
being general.

6. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
The center bias was definitely a big issue in the gaze tracking datasets from
Georgia Tech. Perhaps, in the construction of fixation ground truth, the subjects
should be allowed freedom of head movement. This would make the labelling a bit
more difficult since the chin is not fixed, but would definitely lessen the
amount of center bias, at least.

DISCUSSION POINTS
================================================================================

0. The saliency object detection algorithm in this algorithm seems very similar
to CMPC. What are some of the differences between this and CMPC?

1. The model presented in the paper generates object masks by simple thresholding.
What are some ways we can change this to provide performance gains?
