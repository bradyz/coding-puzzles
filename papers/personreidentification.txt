0. SUMMARY:
This paper presents a method to try to address the problem of person
re-identification. This problem is particularly difficult due to the large
variance of one person in different viewpoints, illumination, etc. Their method
is composed of the use of Retinex to handle illumination, followed by a new
feature represenation called LOMO, followed by a mapping to a subspace called
XQDA, which allowed for efficient comparisons.

1. MAIN CONTRIBUTION:
This method introduced a feature representation that is more robust against
viewpoint changes and illumination changes, the more challenging problems that
occur in the problem of person re-identification. The paper also shows the
great benefits when using Retinex (large performance boosts).

2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES:
One of the major strengths of this approach the runtime for XQDA. There is a
closed form solution that outperform the more expensive iterative methods.
The complexity of the method can be very important depending on application,
and this method's runtime can allow it to be an online system for video
surveillance.
A weakness, however, is if the sigma matrix is singular. Then, we will not
be able to find a solution for the distance function. Also, I do not see how
adding a regularizer to the diagonal elements can prevent the matrix from
being singular.

3. INSPIRING TOPICS:
I thought it was quite novel and intuitive of the high level breakdown of their
approach. Since the data is noisy in terms of coor and illumination, they first
applied Retinex. Then, viewpoint is also a problem so they did feature extraction
on multiple scales, and on multiple horizontal windows. Finally, this feature
vector is too large, so they did a reduction onto a smaller subspace (XQDA).

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
The datasets used are VIPeR (more challenging), QMUL (disjoint views), and
CUHK/CUHK03 (large in size). The measure of accuracy was depicted through
rank-1 identification rates.
There are several related works dealing with the same problem, which is split
into two parts - feature representation, and metric learning. This paper shows
the effects of XQDA by applying different feature representations combined
with XQDA (Table 2 and 3). This is appropriate because it will show the raw
benefits of using the XQDA metric/space. There are also end-to-end comparisons
for LOMO+XQDA and other state of the art person reidentification algorithms.

5. EXTENSIONS:
In the theme of recent computer vision topics, a CNN can be used to learn
the feature representation, then we can pair this feature representation with
their XDQA metric/subspace to achieve better performance.

6. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
LOMO has shown to be very efficient to compute, even on commodity machines,
it would be nice to see some runtime numbers for the XQDA measurements.

DISCUSSION POINTS
================================================================================

0. We can see a slight degradation in performance when an automatic pedestrian
detector is used (Table 4). What are some ways to construct a feature representation
that is robust again body parts missing?

1. In the VIPeR dataset, the gap between LOMO+XQDA and the next best method was
quite small in rank-1 identification. What could have caused the huge performance
gap between the presented method and the next best method when using the
CUHK03 database?
