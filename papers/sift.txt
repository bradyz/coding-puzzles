0. SUMMARY:
SIFT is a method for feature generation that creates keys (local feature vectors)
that are invariant to translation, scaling, rotation. The method's invariances
is based on sampling through a scale space, which provides scalability at low
computational cost. This technique gathers its inspiration from biological
and neuroscience processes and is robust to local geometric distortion.

1. MAIN CONTRIBUTION:
Feature generation is essential for the object recognition in computer vision
and SIFT provides an computationally efficient and accurate generation for
scale varying images.

2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES:
The major strength of SIFT is speed, and the feature vectors invariance to small
local distortions and that object recognition is still accurate with occlusions,
as shown in Figure 5.
A weakness of SIFT is that key match must agree very closely with the model's
orientation, scale, and size, and if a model is not associated with a large 
amount of keys, matching the model will be more sensitive to things like 
image distortions and object occlusions.

3. INSPIRING TOPICS:
The robustness to occlusion was impressive as occlusion typically causes
significant increases in error in object matching. The fact that only 3 keys
are needed for robust recognition was also unexpected, especially since 
models typically generate a large amount of feature keys.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
The experiments used to test SIFT consist of changes in the illumination of 
the environment and various direct image transformations like rotation, scaling, 
stretching and lighting. The experiments were appropriate, but additional 
experiments like applying image transformations to only parts of the image
would be beneficial in gauging performance.

5. EXTENSIONS:
In the generation of the scale space, a new smoothed image is created using
a bilinear interpolation of neighboring pixels. We can easily swap the bilinear
interpolation with any variation of 2d interpolation and create a different
scale space and improve stability of image keys.

6. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
SIFT is used for feature generation in the paper Video Google (Sivic 03) and 
is combined with affine covariant regions to give description vectors that are
invariant to affine transformations.
