REVIEW

0. SUMMARY:
This paper addresses the problem of forensic sketch recognition. This problem is
difficult due to the sketch-photo modality gap, memory, and communication to the
artist. The model in this paper focuses on the memory issues and constructs a
more robust approach to forensic sketch matching.

1. MAIN CONTRIBUTION:
The main contributions consist of a new database of forensic sketches, which
are 100 test subjects drawn at different intervals to demonstrate the effects
of memory loss. They also develop a method that produces an image that
tries to reverse some of the forgetting process and is easier to match on the
actual photo.

2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES:
The major strength of this paper is to learn a Gaussian regression matrix
rather than a typical linear projection. Moreover, their joint learning
of the tasks with MTL-GPR is intuitive and effective as the tasks are heavily
related and joint learning can provide additional information.
The weaknesses are that their dataset is a bit small and could benefit from
more samples. This is inherent in the problem they are addressing, however,
since data for this is expensive.

3. INSPIRING TOPICS:
I was suprised in how much the performance benefitted from matching an
intermediate stage of forgetfulness. It seems that this method will continue
to have the best performance since deep learning might be intractable for this
problem given the small datasets.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
There are there datasets used in the evaluation of performance. MGDB is used,
augmented with labeling of 40 binary attributes. Forensic Composite Database
is used, which consists of 51 pairs of photos. And FSMD is used, which has
195 pairs, and a large set of photos to match against. As was stated before,
we can see the datasets are all relatively small, compared to other vision
problems like image recognition. This paper provides a large amount of baselines
to compare against, as well as several other state of the art methods such as
LFDA, FaceVAS, Deep features. The method presented outperforms all of the methods
by a significant margin using rank-k accuracy measurements.

5. EXTENSIONS:
The method in the paper uses a hand crafted feature, HOG and this could easily
be substituted with a different feature vector, such as the output from
some fully connected layer of a CNN trained on facial data.

6. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
Some parts of this paper were a bit dense. I'm not quite sure how the MTL-GPR
learning is done jointly. The performance and rank-1 accuracy was really
surprising given the large variance in sketches - I would imagine small changes
in the artists depiction would lead to learge changes in the HOG feature vector.
This method of matching on the intermediate image reminds me graph algorithms
where breadth first search is performed on both the start and end states to
find and intermediate path which significant constant speedup.

================================================================================

0. Data collection for this tasks is very expensive. Is there any way to
artificially augment the dataset?

1. What other different feature vectors could provide performance benefits for
this model?
