REVIEW
================================================================================

0. SUMMARY:
This paper presents a model for representing facial attributes with first names.
The 100 most common names are used and modeled as a high dimensional vector
that is composed of dense SIFT features aggregated over a spatial pyramid.
Learning the facial attributes through names provides a way to predict names,
gender, and age.

1. MAIN CONTRIBUTION:
This paper is the first attempt to model the relationship between facial
attributes and first names. Socialogy experiments show that names and a person's
characteristics are dependent, and the paper reinforces this belief.

2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES:
The main strength of the paper is their construction of the MFSVM, which allows
for them to effectively split up and use the extremely high dimensional vector
that represents the face. Another main strength is that their approach does not
require extensive human labeling for training. Their input data requires tagged
faces with the name, which is extremely available from various sites (Facebook).
One of the weaknesses is that their results do not seem strong enough to be
strong enough to incorporate this model into learning visual representations.

3. INSPIRING TOPICS:
This idea seems pretty novel in the sense that a name does seem to capture some
sort of representation of the person, and the results, which may seem marginal,
do in fact show that there is some backing behind this.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
The paper introduces a new dataset, Name100, a collection of 100 names, with
800 faces tagged for each name. These faces and names are extracted from Flickr.
The metrics used are mean average precision (MAP) and prediction accuracy.
Their method shows to be 4x random choice when the number of name classes is 100,
which gives me mixed signals. Their model is definitely learning something about
the correlation between names and visual attributes, but I'm sure there are
some forms of bias that have an effect here.

5. EXTENSIONS:
One simple extension would be to predict other traits like socio-economic factors.
This could be done in a similar approach to their age/gender prediction.

6. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
Table 2, which shows the accuracy of their approach based on the number of name
classes, shows an interesting trend, but I can only imagine that the accuracy
would decrease as the number of names increases.

DISCUSSION POINTS
================================================================================

0. There were a couple bias prevention methods in the data collection process,
but what other factors/biases could have been glossed over and effected performance?

1. As we increase the number of classes, will this 1-1 SVM approach scale?
