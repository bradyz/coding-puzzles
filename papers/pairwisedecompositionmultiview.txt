REVIEW
================================================================================

0. SUMMARY:
This paper is on addressing the multi view recognition problem using CNNs and
pairwise decomposition. Multi view recognition is similar to the 2d object
recognition problem, but the camera can move to different viewpoints that could
provide more information to better confidence. In this approach, pairwise images
from the sequence are used to classify, and predict the next best view.

1. MAIN CONTRIBUTION:
The main contributions from this paper are advances in multi view object recognition,
which are more flexible compared to other related works. The specific problems
worked on are generated NBV (next best view), and optimizing trajectory,
which is important in applications such as robotics.

2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES:
The main strength of this method is the flexiblility and ease of adding
additional data (depth along with greyscale). This method skips the
intermediate step that other related works based on generative models operate on,
and does not have the hard constraint of having fixed length sequences.

3. INSPIRING TOPICS:
The use of CAD models to train and test is really interesting since there is the
trajectory and views can be better represented and less noisy than doing training
and testing in the real world. Using computer models seems to be very beneficial
for training for the NBV task since real world training would be siginificantly more
expensive.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
There were two data sets used for this task - ModelNet10 and ModelNet40. The two
datasets consist of 3D meshes labeled with categories. The two datasets have
on the order of thousands of unique objects. The experiments are appropriate for
the recognition problem and it was good to see the relative performance when
the number of views changes. This really shows how the effectiveness of NBV and
classification are related.

5. EXTENSIONS:
The training method could be extended by using real world pictures of well
photographed places, as this would provide multiple viewpoints that could be used
for the classification part of the method.

6. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
It seems pretty difficult to compare different methods for the multiview recognition
given that each method has its own specific set of requirements.

DISCUSSION POINTS
================================================================================

0. Different methods in multiview recognition seem to have very specific constraints
on the inputs. How can we devise a way to compare them "fairly"?

1. The ModelNet datasets seem expensive to construct. Is there some sort of
self supervisory signal that we could use to do training?
