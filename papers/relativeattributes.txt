0. ABSTRACT:
ranking function - strength of each attribute in image
training data - object/scene pairwise relation and strength
advantage - more intuitive than binary attribute

1. INTRODUCTION:
traditional - map low-level image features to category labels
visual attributes - human-designated labels
zero-shot - helped by visual attributes
binary property - has a head, determined by classification probability
visual search - naturally solved by relative visual attributes
ranking function - estimate real-valued rank 
regression - unnatural to rate a person's presense of a smile
contribution 1 - relative visual attributes is new
contribution 2 - zero-shot learning from comparisons
contribution 3 - image description

2. RELATED WORK:
binary attributes - presense of attribute
relative information - models similarity in categories, no order
learning to rank - distance metrics, nearest neighbors

3. APPROACH:
training - images, attributes, O_m ordered, S_m similar
goal - learn ranking function for each attribute, maximize satisfy constraints
non-negative slack variables - quadratic loss, similarity constraints
balance - between separation margin and satisfy pairwise constraints
unseen categories - described relative to a few seen categories
dimension reduction - feature vector to attribute rank vector
generative model - for seen categories, gaussian, mean and covariance
describing image - pick ranked attributes such that close but nontrivial

4. EXPERIMENTS:
Outdoor Scene Recognition Dataset - OSR, 2688 images from 8 categories, use GIST
Public Figure Face Database - PubFig, 8 people x 100 images
binary - fails to distinguish some categories
relative - teases apart distinction
compare - learned ranks vs binary classifier as rank
learnt classifier - use binary svm to generate ordering
binary description - loses descriminatory proeprties as categories added
Direct Attribute Prediction - DAP model, binary classifier score
Score Based Relative Attributes - SRA, replaces rank with binary classifier score
results - outperforms DAP, SRA, all fall with increasiing categories
robust - when supervision is "more loose"
experiment - asked people which picture fits description best

5. CONCLUSION:
summary - relative is better than binary
applications - zero shot learning, image description

0. SUMMARY:
Relative attributes is a technique that assigns a ranking function to each
attribute rather than formulate a classification problem. Using relative
attributes, more knowledge about the object is given, while also being more 
natural to human labelers.

1. MAIN CONTRIBUTION:
Previously attributes had always been described with binary attributes. The paper 
also provides applications towards zero shot learning and image description 
relative to other images and categories.

2. STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES:
The major strength of this paper is that the training examples can be acquired
in a much more natural way, which also provides for a better understanding of 
the image. When an ordering is provided for a set of images, there is a lot of
implicit knowledge gained, which explains the better performance over using
strictly binary attributes.
A weakness would be that some attributes are more subtle and harder to 
differentiate which could lead to a "bad" ranking function learned.

3. INSPIRING TOPICS:
I thought it was interesting how the zero shot learning method was formulated,
reducing the problem in dimensionality from the size of the original feature 
vector, to a vector the size of the number of categories. The ranking function
is also very intuitive to understand and seems like a natural way to represent
attributes.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
There are two popular datasets used, OSR and PubFig. The paper provides a 
couple of different ways to evaluate performance. There is a comparison 
between ordering attributes, a zero shot experiment, a test on the how the 
amount of supervision affects results, and a human subject test for image
descriptions. The experiments are valid and formulated to provide a good
baseline to how relative attributes performs, the only extension I would like 
to see is how the number of categories affects performance, since there were 6
in the tests, but the number of attributes typically is much larger.

5. EXTENSIONS:
As mentioned in the paper, there are a lot of ways to formulate an image
description, and the hard part is, given the attribute rankings, how to 
decide which attributes make an image distinct. One way to find good reference
images would be to try to cluster the ranks into groups and find two surrounding
clusters.

6. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
Relative attributes makes me think this could be formulated as a graph problem,
and classifying new images becomes a graph similarity problem.

DISCUSSION POINTS
================================================================================

0. Is there some natural way to generate the relationships modeled in the
similarity and ordered set used in the training data?

1. How would this method perform when the number of categories increases to 
another order of magnitude?
