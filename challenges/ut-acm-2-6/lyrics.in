You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time. Could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
