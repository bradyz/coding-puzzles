inverse transpose of model times the frag normal

ambient term - way to fake global illumination

subdivision
- increases number of vertices
- weighted averaging of neighbors
- interpolation over neighbors

mesh improvement
- mario botsch
- subdivision followed by simplication

mesh simplification
- decreases number of vertices
- average, neighbor, error quadric
- edge collapse, edge 

decimation operators
- vertex removal needs to be followed by 
  new triangulation

hierarchical data structure
- binary space partition
- bounding volume hierarchy
- kd-trees
- octrees, quadtrees (dependent on dimensions)
