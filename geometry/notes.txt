inverse transpose of model times the frag normal

ambient term - way to fake global illumination

subdivision
- increases number of vertices
- weighted averaging of neighbors
- interpolation over neighbors

mesh improvement
- mario botsch
- subdivision followed by simplication

mesh simplification
- decreases number of vertices
- average, neighbor, error quadric
- edge collapse, edge 

mesh consistency
- face normal direction
- manifold (water tight)
- self intersection
- t junctions

decimation operators
- vertex removal needs to be followed by 
  new triangulation

hierarchical data structure
- binary space partition
- bounding volume hierarchy
- kd-trees
- octrees, quadtrees (dependent on dimensions)

computered aided design

Interpolating and Approximating Implicit Surfaces from Polygon Soup (Chen Shen)
polygon soup - no constraints on structure (manifold, self intersections)
moving least squares -
partition of unity -

Biharmonic Coordinates (Ofir Weber)
barycentric coordinates - 
identity reproduction - linear precision
partition of unity - constant precision

Topology-Constrained Surface Reconstruction From Cross-sections (Tau Ju)
bell number - double exponential growth
dynamic programming over slices, genus, components

Vouga
- look at window of 3 slices
- physically based scoring function
- dynamic programming
