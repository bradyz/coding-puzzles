inverse transpose of model times the frag normal

ambient term - way to fake global illumination

subdivision
- increases number of vertices
- weighted averaging of neighbors
- interpolation over neighbors

mesh improvement
- mario botsch
- subdivision followed by simplication

mesh simplification
- decreases number of vertices
- average, neighbor, error quadric
- edge collapse, edge 

mesh consistency
- face normal direction
- manifold (water tight)
- self intersection
- t junctions

decimation operators
- vertex removal needs to be followed by 
  new triangulation

hierarchical data structure
- binary space partition
- bounding volume hierarchy
- kd-trees
- octrees, quadtrees (dependent on dimensions)

computered aided design

Interpolating and Approximating Implicit Surfaces from Polygon Soup (Chen Shen)
polygon soup - no constraints on structure (manifold, self intersections)
moving least squares -
partition of unity -

Biharmonic Coordinates (Ofir Weber)
barycentric coordinates - 
identity reproduction - linear precision
partition of unity - constant precision

Topology-Constrained Surface Reconstruction From Cross-sections (Tau Ju)
bell number - double exponential growth
dynamic programming over slices, genus, components

Vouga
- look at window of 3 slices
- physically based scoring function
- dynamic programming

Reaction-Diffusion Patterns (fish spots)
- Gray Scott model
- Chemical reaction and concentration
- Two particals diffuse through grid, different speeds
- r = -(1/a) (d[A])/dt
- arrhenius equation rate equation
- ficks law describes flow rate through a cross sections
- calculate gradients by divided differences
- antisotropic - can change diffuse rates in dimension

Particle Effects
- Move particles according to neighboring and environment
- Remove particles that exceed lifetime
- Potential fields - avoid collisions
- Natural attractor force

Flocking Rules
- Separation (repel neighbors) - perception volume
- Allignment (steer toward average velocity)
- Cohesion (steer towards average position)
- Avoidace (away from obstacles)

Stable Masonry Structure 
- Infinitely strong under compression
- no tensile strength, does not resist pulling
- sufficient friction prevents sliding
- Finite Element Analysis - each block is stiff but still elastic
- Equilibrium Analysis - everything perfectly rigid

Finite Element Analysis
- Energy function - original position and final position function
- relax energy function subject to contact constraints
- structure is stable if connected
- material failure is unimportant
- structure failure caused by bad geometry 

Block Networks
- Balance of force, and torque (doesnt spin)
- Safe Theorem - spine of structure, if spine remains in structure then is stable
- true forces do not need to be known
- more tension vibrates less
- thrust line

Discrete Equilibrium (static)
- summation of forces on vertices = 0
- iterative algorithm, find best weights, move in direction
- scalar stress potential, airy stress surface
- if airy surface is phi convex, curvatures coupled, same base mesh
- unique pq remeshing - technique
